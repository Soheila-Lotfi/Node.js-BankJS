## Instructions

`bank.js` takes in user inputs via the command line to register bank transactions.

* The transactions possible are:

  * `total` - this should tally up all of the money in the bank balance and display it for the user.

  * `deposit <number>` - this should add a positive amount to the bank balance. (No need to display the total here)

  * `withdraw <number>` - this should add a negative amount to the bank balance. (No need to display the total here)

  * `lotto` - this should subtract an amount from the bank balance, but if a random number is hit it should add back a larger amount into the bank balance.

* For all deposits, withdrawals, or lotto purchases the transaction should be registered in the `bank.txt` file.
